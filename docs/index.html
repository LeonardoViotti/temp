      <p>
        If you have suggestions of plots you would like to see in this library
        and are not currently here, you can open an
        <a href="https://github.com/worldbank/stata-visual-library/issues">issue</a>
        describing your suggestion.

        No previous knowledge of GitHub is needed to do this.

        Please read already existing issues to check whether someone else has
        made the same suggestion or reported the same error before creating a new issue.
      </p>

    <h4>Contributing through GitHub</h4>

    If you have graphs you would like to add to this library and are comfortable using GitHub,
    fork the repository and submit a pull request to the master branch with
    any additions you want to make.

    Please read the guidelines below on code, branching and folder structure
    conventions before opening a pull request.

    <h4>Contributing via e-mail</h4>
    <p>

      you can send an e-mail to dimeanalytics@worldbank.org.

      Use the subject "Contribution to Stata Visual Library" and attach a zipped folder
      containing (1) the de-identified data used to create the plot,
      (2) the code that creates the plot from such data, and
      (3) the ado-file for any user-written command not published in SSC.
    </p>

      sending your contribution.

      We also recommend that you create a GitHub account and include your GitHub
